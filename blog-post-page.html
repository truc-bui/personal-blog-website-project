      She nervously peered over the edge. She understood in her mind that the view was supposed to be beautiful, but
      all
      she felt was fear. There had always been something about heights that disturbed her, and now she could feel
      the
      full
      force of this unease. She reluctantly crept a little closer with the encouragement of her friends as the fear
      continued to build. She couldn't help but feel that something horrible was about to happen.
      <br></br>
      This is important to remember. <span class="content-bold">Love isn't like pie</span>. You don't need to divide
      it among all your friends and loved
      ones. No matter how much love you give, you can always give more. It doesn't run out, so don't try to hold
      back
      giving it as if it may one day run out. Give it freely and as much as you want.
      <br></br>
      It really doesn't matter what she thinks as it isn't her problem to solve. That's what he kept trying to
      convince
      himself. She was trying to insert her opinion where it wasn't wanted or welcome. He already had a plan and
      even
      though that plan didn't correspond with what she wanted him to do or what should be done, it wasn't her
      decision
      to
      make. <i class="content__italic">The question now became whether he would stick to his convictions and go
        through with his plan knowing she
        wouldn't approve.</i>

      <u class="content__underline">Dragons don't exist they said</u>. They are the stuff of legend and people's
      imagination. Greg would have agreed with
      this assessment without a second thought 24 hours ago. But now that there was a dragon staring directly into
      his
      eyes, he questioned everything that he had been told.

      Dave found joy in the daily routine of life. He awoke at the same time, ate the same breakfast and drove the
      same
      commute. He worked at a job that never seemed to change and he got home at 6 pm sharp every night. It was who
      he
      had
      been for the last ten years and he had no idea that was all about to change.
      <q class="content__quote">I'm going to hire professional help tomorrow. I can't handle this anymore.</q> She
      fell over the coffee table and now
      there is blood in her catheter. This is much more than I ever signed up to do.
      The towels had been hanging from the rod for years. They were stained and worn, and quite frankly, just plain
      ugly.
      Debra didn't want to touch them but she really didn't have a choice. It was important for her to see what was
      living
      within them.
      Her hand was balled into a fist with her keys protruding out from between her fingers. This was the weapon her
      father had shown her how to make when she walked alone to her car after work. She wished that she had
      something a
      little more potent than keys between her fingers. It would have been nice to have some mace or pepper spray.
      He
      had
      been meaning to buy some but had never gotten around to it. As the mother bear took another step forward with
      her
      cubs in tow, she knew her fist with keys wasn't going to be an adequate defense for this situation.
      The wolves stopped in their tracks, sizing up the mother and her cubs. It had been over a week since their
      last
      meal
      and they were getting desperate. The cubs would make a good meal, but there were high risks taking on the
      mother
      Grizzly. A decision had to be made and the wrong choice could signal the end of the pack.

      They decided to find <u class="content__underline">the end of the rainbow</u>. While they hoped they would
      find a pot of gold, neither of them truly
      believed that the mythical pot would actually be there. Nor did they believe they could actually find the end
      of
      the
      rainbow. Still, it seemed like a fun activity for the day, and pictures of them chasing rainbows would look
      great
      on
      their Instagram accounts. They would have never <b class="content__bold">believed</b> they would actually find
      the end of a rainbow, and when
      they did, what they actually found there.
